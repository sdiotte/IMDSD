# IMDSD
Code Kentucky Python 1 Project

Project Brief:
According to Ocrolus.com, 75% of data loss is caused by human error and 58% of service downtime is attributable to human mistakes. During a system replacement project, the need for accuracy is especially important when mapping the legacy system to the replacement system. Rarely, are two systems identical, requiring many hours to be spent analyzing the two systems, their data and the needs of the business this system supports. Errors during this phase of the project can caused fundamental errors down the road, leading to hours of troubleshooting and downtime.

I believe we can greatly reduce the amount of downtime and troubleshooting hours by automating 95% of data sanity checks performed during system replacement projects.

Data:
.DAT - Files with this extension are automatically generated flat files containing binary text for a program or application, these are accompanied by FMT files. 
.FMT - Files with this extension are flat files used to tell a system and users what the format of the .dat file is.
